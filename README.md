## How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
* talking directly with users and stakeholders
* observing real behavior (user feedback, logs, testing)
* User stories help by making human goals more structred for software. With user stories you can break it into techincal tasks, define test cases from acceptance criteria and validate that implementatin actually solves the original need

## How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
The biggest thing with Agile is communication and collaboration. Retrospectives a one that I would incorporate because it gives a good review of the project. Helps understand what went good and what can be improved on for the next Sprint.

## What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
I think it means to be open and transparent. To be able to collaborate with other team members. To write clean, maintanable and testable code.
